# n_scen_adsb_attack

This repository contains the implementation of various jammers, spoofers, and attacks for simulating the ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) system. It provides a set of scripts for running different jamming and spoofing attacks, as well as a common statistics file for collecting the results.

## Requirements

Before executing the attack, make sure to install the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x** (any version of Python 3 should work)
- **Required Python libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

### Installing Dependencies

You can install the required libraries using `pip`. To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn
